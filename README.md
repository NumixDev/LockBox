# LockBox
The best Password manager in da world

You need to edit the JSON file to add accounts! (it is way more safe trust me)

Example:

{
    "YourAccount": "YourPassword"
}

If you want to add multiple accounts, add colons at the end of the line PLEASE


! IMPORTANT !
If the runner.bat doesn't load the main program, edit the letter of the .bat program to you'r harddrive letter:

E:\
cd E:\main\confi
start cmd /k "py main.py"

to:

X:\
cd X:\main\confi
start cmd /k "py main.py"
